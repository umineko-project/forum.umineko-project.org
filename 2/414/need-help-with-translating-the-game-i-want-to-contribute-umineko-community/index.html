	<div class="content">Hey! I'm a translator (as a hobby) and i want to translate the whole Umineko to my language, Turkish, as there are a lot of fans that are turkish but can't speak english and want to read Umineko rather than watching an unfinished anime.<br>
<br>
However, i know nothing about programming and i couldn't reach the game's script files (i downloaded umineko project version). If there's someone that can help me, please do because i want to do this when i have a really long free time. <br>
<br>
I want to translate the game from japanese to turkish. Not english to turkish. I am a japanese language and literature student so i also want to study japanese while translating the game. Is there a program/script editor/way for me to translate the game like this:<br>
<br>
1st: (Japanese text)<br>
2nd: (English version of it)<br>
3rd: an empty box for me to translate (and then somehow make it the text that appears ingame)<br>
<br>
I translated Danganronpa 2 in that method and it was really convenient for me, but if that's not possible, i'm okay to see only the japanese text and then translating it to turkish. But as i said, i couldn't even reach the script files myself, i need help for the sake of turkish fans  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":cry:" title="Плачет или сильно расстроен"> <br>
