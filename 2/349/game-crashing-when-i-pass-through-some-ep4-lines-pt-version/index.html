	<div class="content">So<br>
I've been reading the portuguese port for a while and I'm finally at EP4. <br>
<br>
In the 11th chapter of it there are some lines crashing the gaming... apparently it's some issue having to do with the audio files. The voice ones...<br>
<br>
I get this error: <br>

<br>
And then the game crash after this. By the way, it's not just this line. A lot of lines in this chapter end up the same way.<br>
Before, there wasn't an error like this, so I wonder what it could be <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":(" title="Грустный"><br>
Could you help me? T-T I've been reading this patch with my girlfriend and it was very much well done so I wish to continue as soon as possible</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi, That looks like you have a corrupted file there. Perhaps you have an HDD failure, FS corruption, or something similar. My first suggestion will be to redownload the files, but it is not clear whether there are any hardware issues.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
