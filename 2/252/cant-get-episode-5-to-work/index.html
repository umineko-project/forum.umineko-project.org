	<div class="content">Thank you for the release of Episode 5! Unfortunately, I can't seem to get the game to play. I downloaded and extracted all the files in a folder as stated in the downloads section, but when I click to open the game, it says I'm missing a ton of files for some reason? Then I tried extracting all the files to my old umineko folder containing episodes 1-4 (and replaced all the doubles), but then it says fail to launch directory when I click to open the game.  <br>
<br>
What am I doing wrong? Thank you!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hello, it is a bit hard to say what went wrong with such a report. Perhaps the best way at this point will be to reinstall the game enitrely, as there is a possibility the first 4 episodes were not fine either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is strange since I had no problem with the earlier episodes, but I shall retry. <br>
<br>
So all of Episode 5's files should be installed to the same folder containing the first 4 episodes or a separate folder altogether? I thought it was two separate games, but please correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
Moreover, when I had tried extracting everything originally (from Episode 5 SOLELY), the chiru extras rar and the chiru game files rar both have identical files (which makes me have to replace one over the other or vice versa... which makes no sense). I think they were the graphics folder and the chiru.file*</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Um, firstly let me explain the situation with the previous releases. They had very basic game file verification built in (few random files were selectively size-checked or even simpler: checked for presence on disk without any content checking), and thus it was comparably frequent to discover people with corrupted installations. By supporting multiple operating systems for us it is very hard to build a tool/installer that would work everywhere, and thus all the mess with the files. We believe it will get simpler when we reach EP8.<br>
<br>
To workaround the issues at present starting with episode 5 we implemented a complete game file verification, which could unveil most of the hidden failures to properly install the game bith old and new.<br>
<br>
Now about the game. It was and is a single game, which contains all the episodes in itself, so chiru is basically an addon you extract into the game folder (which is now mandatory). We tried to explain it at a usual place describing on how to update files, but I guess it is still imperfect: <a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/how-to-upgrade/" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">https://umineko-project.org/en/how-to-upgrade/</a><br>
<br>
Regarding the files, we try to make less changes to the larger game archives, and as a result we have several "large" game packs like backgrounds, graphics, videos… which one updates to get the latest changes. Chiru archives are one of the updates, and "extra" is an overall update that always comes last and contains the latest changes we made yet not included in the original files.<br>
<br>
Hope it helps!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks so much! I've redownloaded and reinstalled everything from scratch. The game opens and I'm able to play episode 5 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается"> <br>
<br>
However, I do get this problem which I'm not quite sure why I do (since I've installed extra last). <br>
I would sometimes get this black bar across the top of many CGs and even in the CG gallery, certain boxes (especially the first one) would remain black and when clicking on them, the image would have the black bar right across the top. <br>

	<div class="content">I think it is an issue with your GPU drivers. Try adding the following line to your ons.cfg file:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code:</p><pre><code>no-glclear</code></pre></div>
See more details on <a href="https://umineko-project.org/known-issues" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">https://umineko-project.org/known-issues</a>. To open ons.cfg you may want to use Notepad++ (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org" class="exlinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">https://notepad-plus-plus.org</a>), Wordpad, or maybe Windows Notepad (but I am not 100% confident in it, sometimes it breaks newlines).<br>
<br>
If no-glclear does not help… perhaps you could try switching to ANGLE 2 or ANGLE 3 renderer in preferences. But you may get worse performance (or actually better depending on your luck).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi, this file should be created once you run the game for the first time. In case you had the existing savedata it might not have happened, mhm, to workaround it just visit the settings and switch the game language to Russian and back to English (literally just click on the right arrow twice). The file will be there. Sorry.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
