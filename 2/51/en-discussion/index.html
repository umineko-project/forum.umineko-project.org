O great Witch of Miracles,<br>
<br>
7-Zip at least should work, but you may not have the file associations set correctly for 7-Zip.<br>
.001 is the one you need to open. You can either use "Open with" -- the program is <div class="codebox"><p>Code:</p><pre><code>C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe</code></pre></div>
or load up the 7-Zip file manager directly (search "7-Zip File Manager" in start) and adjust the file associations from Tools &gt; Options.<br>
<br>
Note that you will need the password (explained <a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/copyright-message/" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">here</a>) to open these files. If you don't have it, keep hold of the files and consider helping us out with alpha-testing ... <a href="https://forum.umineko-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">the thread</a> for this will open very soon <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается"><br>

Maybe the download was incomplete? You could try checking the filesize.<br>
<br>
backgrounds_10.07.15.7z.001 should be 1,047,527,424 bytes / 1,022,976 KB / 999 MB.<br>
backgrounds_10.07.15.7z.002 should be 377,126,907 bytes / 368,288 KB / 359 MB.<br>
<br>
If those are correct, and you are definitely trying to open the .001 archive, maybe you have too old a version of 7-Zip. It should require v9.35 or newer (15.x series preferred). You can find that information in Help &gt; About in the 7-Zip File Manager.<br>

FYI, Mangagamer already announced they were going to release Umineko on steam, HOWEVER the release won't have voice acting (I think), and will use the Umineko Pachinko Game sprites (this version uses the PS3 spites):<br>

<br>
So if you want you can buy the game on Steam, but I think this version should end up much better than the Steam version. Reasons not to make a Steam patch to add in what's in the Umiproject version is addressed in the <a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/frequently-asked-questions/" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">FAQ of Umiproject</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">After extracting all the archives ("extra" should be extracted last), you should end up with a folder which has in it: the game program, the script, some other files, and several subfolders, which should be called exactly "backgrounds", "graphics", and so on. If your unzip tool has some "Extract here/directly into this folder" option, that's probably the one you want.<br>
<br>
If you go into the "backgrounds" folder, it shouldn't have another folder that is also called "backgrounds" in it -- if you have that, it's been wrongly extracted. There should be just one backgrounds folder with the image files in it directly. A similar kind of thing applies for the other folders.<br>
<br>
Similarly, there shouldn't be an "extra" folder -- if you have that, it probably has subfolders in it that belonged in the main folder instead. The extra "backgrounds" folder is meant to automatically merge with and overwrite the existing "backgrounds" folder, which is why it needs to be extracted last.<br>
<br>
If you notice things are in the wrong place, it's probably easiest just to delete the extracted files and try a clean extract <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается"> It should all work with "extract here".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hello, <br>
You are not the first one asking about translating our port into another language and I am afraid it is still not the time for something like that to happen. We are eager to see Umineko being localised in more languages, however we realise that translating it (or even updating the existing translation, e.g. Chinese, Spanish) will take a lot of time and effort, and we would prefer this effort to not be wasted. <br>
<br>
At this point we are not done with both the scripts and the engine, and providing any way to modify them will be rather problematic due to updates that could make one or the other incompatible. We certainly do not want to get in a situation where we fix an issue we spotted, but a side fork is abandoned, and therefore the change will not be applied there. Moreover, the engine as it is now is not tolerant to script errors, and by allowing unskilled people to edit them we risk getting blamed for issues that were not created by us.<br>
<br>
We have a relatively complicated automated build system which is regenerating scripts for our engine automatically based on ps3 game disassembly and translation texts. if we integrated a translation into another language in it, it could work this way. However, it is not the only game part that needs to be translated, there also are menus and graphics. Even though this is the best and pretty much the only way to do it right, <em class="text-italics">for the time being</em> we unfortunately have no resources to help other translators. We are very sorry.<br>
<br>
Anyway, each case will be reviewed individually, and we understand all the privacy of not allowing such announcements to be spread earlier than they should be. Feel free to contact us in private by emailing or via jabber (we have it on talk.umineko-project.org, let me know your nickname) to give us more details on what you/your team would like to do, and we can see what can be done in the future.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now there actually are ways to improve performance even with such deadly devices but I would still not expect it to be mostly playable. Once I tried running the port on something like C60 it was equally funny. <br>
You could go with these options: <em class="text-italics">force-fps=30</em> (maybe 25 or so) to reduce refresh rate and increase the time for background work, <em class="text-italics">hwconvert=disable</em> if yuv shader conversion runs in software and is terrible, <em class="text-italics">no-glclear</em> could speedup things a bit but might break things.<br>

Why are we using fixed 256 kbps bitrate though?

<br>
Right now the scripts for the different languages are entirely separate, and we would have to rework a lot of things so they could be done on the fly instead. <br>
<br>
Also, it was an intentional decision originally not to include Japanese, to discourage using our work as a replacement for the original PS3 games (it's intended as a way for non-Japanese-speakers to enjoy the game...), though I understand that doesn't take account of players like you who have a partial understanding of Japanese. In fact, I've wanted this feature for editing, too, but it's just unlikely we'd spend time on it over other things -- it's not important enough.<br>

I wish you luck with your Japanese -- hopefully you can read Umineko in either language in a few years' time <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Thanks for the report. That's actually not a typo but a bug present in the rendering engine we discovered and fixed some time ago.<br>
Since the issue is not considered critical and we had no time to properly test it the public release is still not updated.<br>
<br>
For this reason I sent you a personal message with a link to a prerelease engine that incorporates several bugfixes not present in the public one including:
<ul><li>Fixed quadrupled quaking and boat shaking speeds;</li>
<li>Fixed new line text rendering issues;</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak causing a rare crash at glyph caching failure;</li>
<li>Fixed launching the game from unicode paths on Windows;</li>
<li>Fixed parsing of certain default.cfg/ons.cfg configs.</li></ul>

Let us know if you run into any other bugs.<br>
<br>
Additionally if anybody else experiences any of these issues, feel free to drop me a PM and I will give you a link as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well they did say when episode 8 beta was released that it is their time to rest and that they leave anything major to others to do.

This is not a typo. The origins of the phrase have nothing to do with either "desert" in the sense of the place with a lot of sand, nor are they related to "desserts", the food, even though the latter would make some sort of metaphorical sense. Instead, the "deserts" in "just deserts" is an outdated noun form of the verb "deserve". In other words, she got a helping of "what she justly (rightfully) deserves". You can search this up on Google for more informtion, but that's the tl;dr on it.<br>

EN script: Witch Hunt translation edited by Umineko Project.<br>
WH script: Witch Hunt translation edited by MangaGamer.<br>
<br>
imo "WH" should be renamed to "MG"...<br>

Ending scroll and songs are always synchronized.<br>
I believe you can't skip it in the PS3 version (although you can skip in the Switch/PS4 version)<br>
