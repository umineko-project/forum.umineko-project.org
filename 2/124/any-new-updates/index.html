	<div class="content">Yo,  I've been following and supporting Umineko project for some time now.  Thanks for all your hard work.  I really appreciate it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Очень доволен"><br>
<br>
As for the subject,  I just casually opened Umineko today and it said It been 3 months since the last update and game might have been outdated.  <br>
So I just realized too that it has been a while since episode 3 rolled out.  So I'm here just asking about the progress of the work of Episode 4. <br>
<br>
So what's the status of the work of Episode 4? Is project still ongoing steadily? When can we expect a new update?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
As for updates we "silently" pushed a small patch on April, 15 fixing few critical bugs discovered in the initial episode 3 β release. You are recommended to install it (just the engine and scripts) to get rid of certain crashes and the annoying warning <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается">.<br>
<br>
We are working hard on episode 4, and the progress as usual is steady. Unfortunately WH translation quality makes us apply many changes, and the last rondo episode is also the biggest one. There also are certain minor coding issues we are solving so that our bleeding edge updates do not burn people's systems <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Очень доволен"><br>
<br>
If you are interested in checking episode 4 as soon as possible I guess I could recommend you to stay tuned and wait for α-testing announcement, which is going to happen this month. We actually warned our testers about the delay but I guess a more open hint for the whole audience could have been appreciated.<br>

	<div class="content">Thanks for the reply.  <br>
Didn't notice that silent upgrade.  Or any major game breaking bugs.  Except that the screen  went blank once in the episode 2 Credits. I thought it was because I was running too many programs at once.  <br>
And I'll install that update too. <br>
<br>
Alpha-testing sounds ingesting.  I'll be looking foreword to it.<br>
And once again, thanks for all your hard work <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Очень доволен"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
