	<div class="content">Hello. I was wondering if anyone could help me resolve the problem I have and get to playing the game. Everytime I start the game I get this showing up <br>

<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="BSp0Hqf.jpg" class="postimage" alt="BSp0Hqf.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);"></dt>
						<dd>BSp0Hqf.jpg (54.69 KiB) Viewed 13710 times</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
			</div>

I attached a screenshot of my game folder for anyone that wants to look over it. I have extracted multiple times with no errors. <br>

<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="Screenshot_20210508-190522_My%20Files.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Screenshot_20210508-190522_My Files.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);"></dt>
						<dd>Screenshot_20210508-190522_My Files.jpg (493.23 KiB) Viewed 13710 times</dd>
		</dl>

 I made it to game verification once and never got it to work since then. I have also added the witch hunt scripts and have the latest main scripts and resources. Any help I resolving the issue would be appreciated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sorry, given the screenshot, your device is not compatible.

Why is that? And will it ever gain support?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Basically the issue is that we do not have Android devices at all. I can debug on iOS, but not on Android. There is also a bigger issue of different Android devices behaving differently. And they are not just behaving differently, they have various bugs and glitches, like the one you have, which need unintuitive hacks and workarounds we cannot guess prior to exploring them.<br>
<br>
Long story short, to support your device we would have had to get it and find a fair amount of time to explore the issue. That means that the fix is unlikely happening from our side. On the other side, the engine is open-source (<a href="https://github.com/umineko-project/onscripter-ru" class="exlinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">https://github.com/umineko-project/onscripter-ru</a>), and as long as you provide a patch, the problem may be resolved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thank you for your detailed response. I'm not a developer so I wouldn't know what to do with it lol. I do appreciate it though. Hopefully someone will see this eventually and help out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
