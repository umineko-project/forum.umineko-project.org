	<div class="content">So I recently had to completely wipe my ssd because I thought I had a virus and just wanted to make sure I got rid of it<br>
<br>
I didn't back up anything, so I completely lost my save files. I was on episode 4, and I'm thinking about just skipping to episode 4 again and skipping through everything until I get to where I was. But I noticed that if I do that, I won't be able to see all my previous unlocked CGs and I won't have any of the music tracks unlocked either.<br>
<br>
Is there any way to skip through the previous episodes and still unlock everything I had before? Or will I just have to deal with it and continue like this? Would suck to not have everything unlocked by the end, but oh well</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
env[complete_episode] 1-8<br>
env[cg_unlock] 1-8<br>
env[bgm_unlock] 1-8<br>

But I recommend using Ctrl/s and just skip the chapters. These settings only write temporary values, which are not saved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
