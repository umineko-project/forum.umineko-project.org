	<div class="content">My friend was reading Episode 3, and after advancing to a certain line, the sound cut out completely and was unable to be restored by any standard means, including updating the .exe from r2531 to r2757. I had to reinstall the sound files in order to get it working again. I'm not certain of the exact line, but it was in Chapter Virgilia, and around the time where Virgilia, Battler, Ronove, and Beatrice are talking in the meta world and Beatrice gets flustered and taken away by Ronove. <br>
<br>
The machine was running Windows 10 64-bit. I can get more diagnostic information if you need it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi, are you sure you did not hit the [M]ute key on the keyboard? As far as I know there is really nothing among the known issues that could cause the behaviour like this.<br>
If not, since replacing the sound files worked for you, I would expect it to be coincidence. Perhaps sound driver crashed, or your filesystem got corrupted.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
