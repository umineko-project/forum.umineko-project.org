	<div class="content">Hi to everyone!<br>
<br>
Great project!<br>
I would like to give you a couple of feedbacks if you don't mind. I'm not sure If I'm expected to do it here or in some other topic, so feel free to move this thread somewhere else or to delete it.<br>
<br>
Here go my observations:<br>
<br>
- The credits at the end are way too long/slow (considering that there are two credit rolls, one after the other, the original and yours). It would not be an issue per se, but they are not skippable and it takes forever...<br>
- You should cache the menus :\ it takes forever to open the right click menu or the options in the main menu. <br>
- Sometimes the acting voices are REALLY low compared to the BGM, especially in the 3rd episode.<br>
- Have you considered a mailing list or a rss feed for the updates?<br>
<br>
Have you considered releasing the code of the interpreter? I can see you are not incline to release the scripts because of legal reasons (I would be against it as well in your place). But maybe the interpreter code would get some more attention and would bring a couple of spare hands to help you with your job.<br>
<br>
Anyway, keep with the fantastic job! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Подмигивает"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your warm words. I moved the topic to β-testing since it has more to do with technical details than with Umineko itself <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Подмигивает"><br>
<br>
As for the feedback let me try to answer.

I guess you mostly mean the original ones, ep2 ones are pretty much dreadful. We will think of making them skippable but it is low-pri because implementing that will take a bit longer than reading the text <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Подмигивает">
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You should cache the menus :\ it takes forever to open the right click menu or the options in the main menu. </div></blockquote>
Hmmm, we already do that to some level. Right-click menu opens in less than a second for me, although it is not cached. <br>
I suppose it depends a lot on the HDD speed and the GPU installed. Could you tell me which ones you use?<br>
We will see what can be done in this area either way but maybe not in the nearest future.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sometimes the acting voices are REALLY low compared to the BGM, especially in the 3rd episode.</div></blockquote>
They are matching to PS3, and I am afraid we cannot do anything but suggest you to fine-tune the volume levels in prefs. <br>
If you have certain examples it might be a good idea to point them out, so that we check for a possible sneaky mistake, although it is unlikely.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Have you considered a mailing list or a rss feed for the updates?</div></blockquote>
α-testers do get e-mail notifications from time to time but this is not optional and limited to the group only.<br>
For the rest we have feeds at least: <a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/feed/" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">English</a> | <a href="https://umineko-project.org/ru/feed/" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">Russian</a> | <a href="https://forum.umineko-project.org/feed.php" class="loclinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">Forum posts</a>. <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Umineko-projectOrg" class="exlinks" onclick="this.target='_blank';">Google Plus</a> could be of some use as well, but it requires a Google account.<br>

Last time I had to wait for them I got my lunch ready + a cup of tea... And they were still rolling! Jeez...<br>

The most dreaded is the option menu. It takes a couple of seconds to render. The VN is installed on and SSD drive. My GPU is a 980GTX <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Улыбается"> definitely above average.<br>

I see. I thought you were normalizing the audio files in some way during the ps3 export. In this case normalizing the one that are low volume would be a killing task. About the examples, I'll try to note them down next time I'll find them.<br>

Cool! I didn't know.<br>

Ngggh, a bit annoying. Config menu is indeed very large (even more complex than PS3 one) and it is loading for quite some time regardless of caching. I will try to improve things but won't give any promises.
