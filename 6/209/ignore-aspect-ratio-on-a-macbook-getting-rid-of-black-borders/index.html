	<div class="content">Well the topic says it all i guess.<br>
<br>
In the config-file one can set the width setting manually, but there is no (forced/stretched) hight-option somewhere?<br>
(In order to get rid of the black borders above and below)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Indeed the game is 16:9 and it is impossible to change, because the backgrounds and everything else expects 16:9 (well, that's how Alchemist designed the game). In our opinion black borders were the best for visual looks and experience, because nothing is cut or distorted.<br>
<br>
If you think differently, I guess it still can be discussed but the stretched picture will unlikely feel nice. And if we zoom in some parts will simply be cut, perhaps even the menus or text under some circumstances.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, but thanks for the reply. To stretch the screen to completely remove the black borders might be a bit too much. But if both width and height could be manualy set one might maybe at least make the black borders a little bit smaller without things looking too ugly. But i would not like the team to break their backs over it. (Probably better to get ep5 out instead. I just read that complete chiru thingy will be out on MG/Steam the 18th of November).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
