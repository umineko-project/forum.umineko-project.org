	<div class="content">Hi !<br>
I don't really know what to do anymore, I tried to solve the problem by myself but everytime I launch the game, there's no sound at all.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">System :</strong><br>
OS : Windows 10<br>
Game version : 8.2b r3976<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What I tried :</strong><br>
-Pressing 'M' and 'alt+M'<br>
-Reinstalling everything<br>
<br>
I don't think that the problem comes from my PC because the sound works fine with every other apps I open<br>
There's not any mention that the game is muted in the window title bar<br>
The sound is enabled in game preferences<br>
<br>
Thanks to anyone that could help me, I don't have a clue about what's going on with my game lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"> Hello, I wonder if your hardware does not support 32-bit float sound. You can try other formats by tweaking audioformat in ons.cfg.

Thanks for the answer, but I don't really know how to use ons.cfg. It just looks like a weird file that I can't open, could you please help me ?

I tried everything mentionned in the topic but it still doesn't work at all, my game is always muted and I can't hear any sound at all, pressing alt+m doesn't 'unmute' anything either.<br>
Sometimes, with two of the audioformat values tweaked in ons.cfg, I could hear a little sound while opening or closing the game. It didn't sound like anything directly coming from the game but more like the sound of my PC trying to load the game's audio. Sadly, even then, the sound wouldn't be on and pressing alt+m while in-game didn't change anything<br>
<br>
I don't really know if I can do anything about it. Please let me know if something else can be done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
