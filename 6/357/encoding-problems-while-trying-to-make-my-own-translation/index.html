<br>
So here's the thing, I was wondering if I could create my own translation for portuguese (Portugal's portuguese instead of brazilian portuguese which knox is working on) and started trying stuff. I'm currently using Knox's translation as a base (let me know if I shouldn't be doing that).<br>
<br>
Anyway, here onto the technical issue:<br>
<br>
- First I got the the Knox Translation working on my umineko on android, all good.<br>
- Then I cloned the umineko-scripting repo, and ran the update-manager.php to create a new pt.txt and pt.file (dscript and script commands)<br>
- Then I replaced pt.file on my phone<br>
- This happened:<br>
<br>

<br>
So...I'm guessing there is an encoding issue happening somewhere? I'm running the update-manager on Windows 10, I've already tried with php 5.6 and php 7, same issue (the size of pt.file changes a bit tho). Everything else is fine, voice lines and etc, I've tested and I can change the order of scenes as well so my .file is functional. I've also tried making sure pt.txt is using linux line endings and UTF-8 without bom before generating the .file but still no luck.<br>
<br>
Any help is appreciated! Not sure if this is the best place but couldn't find any docs on this</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just a quick update, it seems I got it working while running the update-manager on linux.<br>
<br>
It's the dscript command which is making the difference, while running it on windows it's not replacing all the japanese chars, did that happen with anyone else? Anyway, got it working - will try debugging it later just for curiosity.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
