	<div class="content">I think you might be referring to the 07th-Mod patch to add PS3 graphics onto the Steam/MangaGamer release, which does support the Steam achievements as well as the play time record.<br>
<br>
Umineko Project is a standalone port of the visual novel built from scratch to match the PS3 version, completely different from the Steam/MangaGamer release. In that regard, you cannot unlock achievements on Steam if you play this port instead. I recommend to use 07th-Mod if you are looking for that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ohhh, okay I see! I have been using the 07th mod, but I saw the lip sync sprites and wished I could patch the steam version with the UmiPro version : ( That's okay though! \ o / Thank you for informing me!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
